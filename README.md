As of March 30, 2022:
Currently creating a blog site for a Christian writer.

The site's backend is currently working, storing Blog Data in MongoDB Atlas. 
On the backend, I am also developing a User Log In with varying credentials to allow varying levels of accessibilities to different users.

Also, completely remaking the Front-End of the Site to make a personal and unique design. 

Home Screen on Mobile:
There are some CSS animations and a working Menu bar made with CSS and Javascript.
